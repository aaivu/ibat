## Summary

Enhancing the real-time bus arrival time prediction in heterogenous traffic condition by addressing concept drift.

## Description

This project aims to enhance the precision of real-time bus arrival time prediction models, particularly in the face of heterogeneous traffic conditions and dynamic external factors. The challenge lies in dealing with 'concept drift', which occurs due to evolving conditions like weather fluctuations, traffic variations, industrial impacts, road management changes, and unforeseen accidents. These factors contribute to a continuous shift in the patterns of bus arrival time data. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative approach that involves the real-time detection of concept drift in the time series data. Once detected, our system quickly adapts to the new patterns by incorporating incremental online learning techniques into the existing state-of-the-art prediction model. This allows our model to efficiently learn from the evolving data within a short timeframe, resulting in more accurate and reliable bus arrival time predictions, ultimately benefiting both commuters and transportation services.

## Objectives
- To survey, identify, and develop a comprehensive suite of concept drift algorithms tailored for our research.
- To develop a robust suite of Incremental online learning algorithms to address real-time bus travel time prediction challenges.
- To survey, identify, and develop suitable evaluation metrics for our context. Develop a framework to assess the impact of Incremental online learning algorithms on bus travel time prediction.
- To identify the optimal combination of concept drift and online learning algorithms, achieving a 5% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the current state-of-the-art model.
